This is an business card application where you read the contents of a business card and make an contact list
This a DB first approach
So First You have to make the database (In this case SQL Local server is used)
There is also two additional requirements to be fulfilled
1. Create an Upload Named Directory in the project folder (where you can find this view folder). This is done just to save the business card files son
that It may be useful in the future (Can be removed at a later point of time)
2. There is an Nuget package called Thoughts.Vcard used to read the contents of the business card. You will have to install that.
